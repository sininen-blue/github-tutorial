requirements.txt is a common file in Python projects that lists the dependencies used

It's not required, since you can just install the packages manually, but it is a best practice to include one for easier setup and deployment.

Especially for larger projects or when sharing your code with others, having a requirements.txt file helps ensure that everyone is using the same versions of the libraries, which can prevent compatibility issues.

# Example content of requirements.txt
flask==2.0.1
requests==2.25.1
numpy==1.21.0

# To create a requirements.txt file, you can use the following command in your terminal:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# and to run the installation of the packages listed in the requirements.txt file, you can use:
pip install -r requirements.txt

note the -r
